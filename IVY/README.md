## 📍 Overview

The repository powers a Go-based, distributed system using gRPC for inter-service communication and Protobuf for data serialization. The system comprises a central manager and several nodes, facilitating coherent read/write operations. It includes features like mutual exclusion for concurrency control, queue management for write requests, error handling, and timeouts. The architecture encapsulates core functionalities within distinct modules, utilizing a web handler for HTTP requests and utility functions for common tasks. This results in an efficient and robust system ideal for managing interoperable, large-scale operations.

| [node.pb.go]({file})         | The project structure indicates a Go based microservice architecture. The main.go file initiates the service, while manager, node, utils, and web directories house the functionality. Autogenerated code from gRPC protocol buffers indicates inter-service communication. The pb and proto directories store protocol definitions and generated code.'SendContentRequest' structure handles content requests. The Makefile builds the service, while go.mod and go.sum manage Go dependencies. |
| [manager.pb.go]({file})      | The provided code is an automatically generated Google Protocol Buffers implementation in Go. It defines services and messages for managing read/write operations. The services, `Write`, `WriteConfirmation`, `Read`, and `ReadConfirmation` handle write and read operations and their confirmations. The messages encapsulate data for these requests and responses. Such data include "page", "source", "content" fields and others for different states, caching, and error handling.       |
| [node_grpc.pb.go]({file})    | The provided Go code is generated by the Protobuf compiler and forms the client and server interfaces for a gRPC service. The service is defined in a file called `node.proto` (protobuf). It offers methods such as `WriteForward`, `Invalidate`, `Send`, `InitWrite`, `InitRead`, `ReadForward`, and `SendContent`. Each method corresponds to a gRPC endpoint that carries out a specific operation, taking in certain parameters and returning specified responses.                          |
| [manager_grpc.pb.go]({file}) | The code defines the interface and implementation details for a gRPC client and server (ManagerService) with four methods: Write, WriteConfirmation, Read, and ReadConfirmation. These methods handle data manipulation and confirmations. It also provides for forward compatibility by embedding an UnimplementedManagerServiceServer and allows for unary server interceptors to modify service behaviour. The protocol buffer input/output requests and responses are also defined here.     |

| [node.proto]({file})    | The code contains a directory structure for a Go-based system using gRPC for inter-service communication. It defines the `NodeService` gRPC service in the `node.proto` file. The service contains methods for writing, reading, and sending data, including methods for initializing these operations. Messages used in these operations include page identifiers, content data, and node information.                                                                                            |
| [manager.proto]({file}) | The code illustrates a Go project layout with a protobuf service definition for a "ManagerService". The services manage writing and reading operations, including confirming these operations. Functions are specified for handling different types of requests and responses, with messages defined for read and write requests and responses, as well as for their confirmations. Every request message includes details like'page' and'source', with'content' relevant for write confirmations. |

| [handler.go]({file}) | This Go code is part of an application that handles read and write requests to nodes in a distributed system. It uses gRPC and protobuf for communication. In essence, users can specify a node and a page (with content for write requests) in HTTP requests. The application sends these as gRPC requests to the appropriate nodes. Errors are raised for invalid nodes or unsuccessful requests. |

| [write.go]({file})   | The code handles the write operations in a distributed manager-cum-node architecture. The key functionalities include sending invalidation request to nodes, forwarding write to page's previous owner, serving writes as a continuous routine, managing and executing incoming write requests, and confirming completion of written data. The mechanism ensures concurrency control and coherence in the system by utilizing mutual exclusion (mutexes) & maintaining a queue of write requests. |
| [read.go]({file})    | The code primarily supports Read operations in a distributed system. `Read` function in the manager package receives read requests, verifies the presence of the requested page, and forwards the request to appropriate nodes. It maintains logs and handles errors. `ReadConfirmation` function handles confirmations of successful reads. It makes use of gRPC for communication and synchronization mechanisms for thread safety.                                                             |
| [manager.go]({file}) | The code defines a `Manager` struct within the manager package, related to a distributed file system. This struct includes methods for writing, reading and management of data across different nodes. It uses Protocol Buffers (pb) as a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. The code is part of a larger Go application and deals with distributed data synchronization and redundancy via mutexes and nodes.                              |

| [write.go]({file}) | The code is for a distributed system node handling page writes. It includes functions to invalidate a specific page, initiate a write, update page content, forward write requests, and confirm writes. It also manages timeouts for write operations and handles errors in communication with the manager node. Each page is tracked for its access level and content, and a local copy of the page is maintained after a successful write.                                                                    |
| [read.go]({file})  | The code describes functions within a node in a distributed system, implementing read operations. The InitRead function checks if it holds the requested page and, if not, sends a request to the manager. The ReadForward function forwards the request to another node if it doesn't hold the requested page. The SendContent function receives content of a requested page and sends a read confirmation to the manager. These operations handle inter-node communication and synchronization in the system. |
| [node.go]({file})  | The provided code snippet is the implementation of a'node' in Go language, including the'read' &'write' functionalities with appropriate access modes. A'node' has properties like'pages','pendingWrites' etc. and functionalities like synchronized access. It's part of a program that possibly employs a gRPC service for inter-process communication, indicated by the protobuf files. It also features a function to initialize a new node.                                                                |
